# 🧭 Kibo Product Vision & Manifesto

> **"We are NOT a bank. We do not hold money; we hold context. Banks process transactions; Kibo processes dreams."**

This document outlines the philosophical and functional pillars of **myKiboCFO**. Every line of code written in this repository must align with this vision.

## 1. Our Mission

**myKiboCFO** is the bridge between complex financial obligations and a peaceful life for Colombians. We are your personal financial ally.

### The Problem

Managing finances in Colombia is chaotic. Tax calendars are confusing, banks are fragmented, and "financial advice" is often disconnected from reality.

### The Solution: The "Kibo Loop"

1. **Ingest:** We aggregate scattered financial data (Banks + DIAN).
2. **Interpret:** We translate "transactions" into "behavioral patterns."
3. **Guide:** We align financial reality with personal dreams.

## 2. The Colombian Advantage 🇨🇴

Foreign apps fail here because they lack context. Kibo is built on three local pillars:

- ✅ **Fiscal Reality:** Native understanding of *Renta*, *ICA*, and *4x1000*. We don't just track spending; we track obligations.
- ✅ **Social Context:** We understand that finances in Colombia are often family/community-centric.
- ✅ **Local Trust:** Full adherence to **Law 1581 (Habeas Data)** is not just compliance; it's our product's foundation.

## 3. Core Capabilities (Functional Specs)

### 🏦 Unified Banking Core (via Belvo)

- **Aggregator Engine:** Seamless integration with major Colombian banks (Bancolombia, Davivienda, Nubank, etc.).
- **Real-time Sync:** Automatic transaction fetching to keep the user's financial picture current.

### 🧠 Kibo Intelligence (Behavioral Engine)

- **Dream-Aligned Analysis:** The user inputs a goal (e.g., "Buy an apartment"). The engine analyzes spending habits to calculate the *real* ETA of that dream.
- **Actionable Insights:** Instead of just charts, we output specific advice: *"If you reduce 'Gasto Hormiga' by 10%, you reach your goal 2 months earlier."*

### 📅 Fiscal & Obligation Shield

- **Tax Radar:** Automated alerts for tax filing dates based on the user's NIT/Cédula.
- **Penalty Prevention:** Proactive notifications before deadlines to avoid DIAN sanctions.

### 🛡️ Trust & Compliance Layer

- **Privacy-First Architecture:** Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Consent Logs:** Immutable records of user consent for data processing.
- **Habeas Data Compliance:** Full adherence to Colombian data protection laws.

## 5. Product Principles

### Design Philosophy

- **Mobile-First:** Most Colombians access financial tools via smartphone.
- **Offline-Capable:** Internet connectivity can be unreliable; core features must work offline.
- **Minimalist UI:** Financial data is complex; the interface should be simple.

### Development Principles

- **Security > Speed:** Never compromise user data for faster deployment.
- **Local Context > Generic Features:** Colombian-specific features take priority.
- **Education > Automation:** Don't just automate; teach users why it matters.

## 6. Success Metrics

We measure success not just in downloads, but in **life impact**:

- **Penalty Avoidance Rate:** % of users who avoid DIAN penalties after using Kibo.
- **Dream Achievement Rate:** % of users who reach their defined financial goals.
- **Financial Peace Score:** User-reported stress reduction (measured quarterly).
